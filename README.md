# User stories are as follows:
- A user should be able to see the name, city, state, phone number, and genres for each restaurant
- A user should see results sorted by name in alphabetical order starting with the beginning of the alphabet
- A user should be able to filter restaurants by state. If a state is selected that does not contain any restaurants, there should be something that indicates no restaurants were found for that state.
- A user should be able to filter by genre.
- State and Genre filters should default to “All”
- A user should be able to enter text into a search field. When hitting the enter key or clicking on a search button, the table should filter results. Search results should match either the name, city, or genre.
- A user should be able to clear the search filter by clearing the text value in the search input.
- A user should only see 10 results at a time and the table should be paginated.
- A user should be able to combine filters and search. The user should be able to turn filters on and off
while a search value is present.
